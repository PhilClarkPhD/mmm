# Candy Crisis

The marketing team at the Sweetums candy company is under pressure from executives to demonstrate that their media strategy is working. They hire us to help them quantify the efficiency of their advertising and tune their investments in various paid channels. They have prepared the file 'marketing_data.csv' for us to work with.

During a call, they tell us that they would like to be able to answer the following questions:
1. How much total revenue can be attributed to paid media?
2. Which channels are performing well and which are performing poorly?
3. What changes in spend could be made to improve overall ROI?

Finally, the head of marketing is worried that the executive team will be skeptical of fancy modeling techniques. He asks us how he can convince leadership that our model is trustworthy.
